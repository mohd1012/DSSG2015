As part of the DSSG program, participants have been blogging about their
experience. In team blogs devoted to the [different project](http://escience.washington.edu/data-science-for-social-good-project-winners-announced), they have been sharing their thoughts
coming into the program, and will continue to share their thoughts about the challenges and victories they encounter along the way. As we enter the second half of the program, a few of the interesting results will also start appearing on these blogs, documenting the progress of the projects.

The blogs can be found at:

- [Predicting permanent housing](http://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2015-predicting-permanent-housing/)

- [Mapping community well-being](http://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2015-wellbeing/)

- [Optimizing paratransit](http://dssg-paratransit.github.io/main_repo/)

- [Creating the accessible sidewalk graph](http://uwescience.github.io/DSSG_sidewalk/)
